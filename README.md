# Tip Jar Smart Contract

## Overview
The Tip Jar is a blockchain-based smart contract designed for Ethereum. It allows individuals or organizations to receive cryptocurrency donations (tips) from anyone. This project showcases skills in Solidity, smart contract development, and Ethereum blockchain principles.

## Features
- **Receive Tips:** Users can send Ether or ERC-20 tokens to the contract as a tip. Tips can only be sent to registered addresses
- **Withdraw Tips:** The registered users can withdraw accumulated tips to their wallet.
- **Registration System:** Only registered Ethereum addresses can receive tips, enhancing security and control.
- **Security Features:** Includes security checks to prevent unauthorized access and common vulnerabilities.
- **ERC-20 Support:** Supports receiving and withdrawing ERC-20 tokens.
- **Withdrawal:** Contract owner cannot withdraw tips, preventing misuse of funds. Only registered addresses can withdraw their own tips.
- **Donation Tracking:** (Optional) Tracks and displays the history of donations and donors.

## How It Works
1. **Registration:** Users register their Ethereum wallet address with the contract.
2. **Receiving Tips:** After registration, the address can receive tips in Ether or ERC-20 tokens.
3. **Withdrawing Funds:** The registered address can withdraw the tips to their wallet.

## Technical Implementation
- Built with Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain.
- Incorporates security features to prevent common vulnerabilities.

## Security and Access Control
- Only registered addresses can receive and withdraw tips.
- Functions include security checks to prevent unauthorized access.

## Testing and Deployment
- Unit tests cover various scenarios like receiving and withdrawing tips, and registration functionality.
- Deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, with contract verification on Etherscan.

## Front-End Integration (Optional)
- A simple UI interacts with the contract using Web3.js or Ethers.js.
- Displays total tips received and enables withdrawals and registration.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding a feature to track ERC-20 token balances and withdrawals.
- Implementing a more advanced frontend interface for a better user experience.
